                        <h2 class="text">A Meaningful Perspective on Accessibility: Insights from the Israeli Chapter</h2>
                        <p class="my-5">
                        Dear ISMRM Leadership,
                        </p>
                         
                        <p class="my-5">
                        Following your request to participate in the survey, we at the Israeli Chapter appreciate the opportunity to share our perspective on the meaning of accessibility, as we believe it should be voiced within the ISMRM.
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-5">
                        In our view, accessibility is a broad term that should always invoke the proper utilization of MRI technology for its intended purpose. We trust that you will make sure to mention that, in Gaza, MRI, designed to save lives, has tragically been repurposed for weapon storage (1), posing a direct threat to the lives of people in the region and hindering patient access to critical medical services.
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-5">
                        Conversely, we are sure that you will give as a prominent example of accessibility Israel's consistent commitment to providing access to medical treatment, including MRI services, for individuals in the West Bank and Gaza, despite the complex situation in the region (2,3). As an example, under the routinely provided medical service to Palestinians from these areas, dozens of patients, including oncological patients and children, receive MRI scans each year at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center as part of their follow-up and treatment. In other Israeli hospitals, these numbers are far greater. Additionally, various Israeli organizations, such as Physicians for Human Rights (4), work towards access to medicine through mobile clinics (5). This access to medical treatment in Israel for Palestinian individuals embodies the meaning of “accessibility” in our view and is a testament to humanitarian values. Ironically and tragically, many of the ravaged kibbutzim in which people were brutally tortured, slaughtered, and kidnapped on October 7th were home to individuals who volunteered for a program known as Road to Recovery, driving sick Gazans to Israeli hospitals for treatment (6,7).
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-5">
                        We believe that the ISMRM should draw attention to the urgent need for ensuring that medical facilities, including MRI units, are utilized exclusively for healthcare purposes, and stress and act for the importance of prioritizing human values above all else.
                        </p>
                         
                        <p class="my-5">
                        Thank you,
                        <br />
                        On behalf of the Israeli chapter's committee
                        </p>

                        <hr />

                        <p class="my-5">                            
                            We are writing to express our deepest concern over the recent discovery of weapons placed by Hamas within an MRI facility at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. This weapons depot, found and filmed by the  Israel Defense Forces  on November 15th, 2023, included among other things, guns, ammunition, and hand grenades – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEhsIJUw1DQ&ab_channel=IsraelDefenseForces">all located inside the MRI clinic including in the immediate proximity of a clinical MRI scanner</a>. These alarming findings raise serious concerns about the safety and integrity of medical facilities in the hospital (and presumably, in other hospitals in the Gaza region as well), which are meant to be sanctuaries for healing and care. Such abuse of hospital facilities not only prevents patients from adequate access to medical diagnosis and treatment – it jeopardizes the lives of patients and medical professionals. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-5">
                            It is crucial to highlight the global shortage of MRI scanners and the significant cost associated with acquiring and maintaining this vital medical equipment(1). The scarcity of these scanners already poses a challenge to healthcare systems worldwide, and the potential destruction or misuse of such valuable resources presents a serious ethical concern that further exacerbates this pressing issue. Considering that only two MRI scanners per million inhabitants are available in the Gaza Strip, the effective usage of each scanner is all the more critical(2). By using these medical facilities for terrorist activities, Hamas is committing a dual crime against humanity, as it is harming its own citizens as well, by depriving them of critical medical equipment. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLp84A6TBJ0&list=PLObnKQho8o8MeR3UM4Yp1tu12eNwU579o&index=8&ab_channel=IsraelDefenseForces">growing evidence of similar systematic misuse of healthcare facilities as havens for Hamas terrorists is mounting in other Gazan hospitals</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-5">
                            We call upon the international medical community, especially radiology specialists and scientists, to unequivocally condemn this misuse of critical medical facilities for military purposes. By speaking out, we can underscore the importance of upholding the highest ethical standards and protecting the sanctity of healthcare institutions. The scientific and medical community must unite in reinforcing the principle that medical equipment be used only as prescribed – to heal and to save lives, and that medical facilities must remain dedicated to serving humanity.

                            We are deeply horrified by and strongly condemn the October 7th terror attacks on Israel carried out by Hamas. These attacks, are comparable to 9/11 in terms of scale, with unprecedented brutality.
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-5">
                            We call on ISMRM to issue an unambiguous condemnation of the terror attack by Hamas, and call for immediate release of the kidnapped Israelis being held hostage by Hamas including babies, toddlers, children and aging seniors of many religions and nationalities.  
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-5">
                            We recognize that the humanitarian crisis in both Israel and Gaza were designed, executed, and sustained by Hamas and their cynical use of human shields to protect their terror infrastructure. We condemn Hamas for bringing death and violence to the region and are heartbroken by the loss of all human lives on both sides, which we consider Hamas unequivocally responsible for.

                        <p>The easiest way to reach the Technion is by taking the cable car from Merkazit Hamifratz station. Merkazit Hamifratz station is the fourth stop from the south in Haifa. </p>
                        <p>The cable car is located near the station, and you can take it directly to the Technion for a cost of 5.9 NIS.</p>                        
                        
                        <p>Once you arrive at the Technion, the closest station to the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering is Technion Center station.</p>
                         
                        <h3>Arriving by car</h3>
